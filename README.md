# DirectStart

## This project aims to recreate the unreleased Start Menu update for Windows 8.1


**Note: This is not a real reimplementation, just a recreation using C# WPF.**

Supported operating systems:

- Windows 10 and 11 all builds (Some features might not be available)
- Windows 8.1 build 9600
- Windows 7 and Vista (With latest free Extended Kernel) (Start Menu background color broken)

**Do not use this software on any mission critical systems! Its purely experimental!**
